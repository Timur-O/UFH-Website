            </ol>



            <h4>Use of Copyright Material and Proof of Ownership of Content</h4>



            <p>
              Sites must not contain Warez, copyright or other illegal material including links or redirects to copyright material hosted on 3rd party websites / resources. The onus is on you the customer to prove that you own the rights to publish material, not for Ultifree Hosting to prove that you do not. Ultifree Hosting does not allow the propagation or distribution of copyright material, files or warez under any circumstances.
            </p>



            <h4>Acceptable Server Resource Use</h4>



            <p>
              Sites must not use excessive amounts of server resources. These include bandwidth, processor utilization and/or disk space.
            </p>



            <h4>Script Usage Terms</h4>



            <p>
              Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and not to use the server as an application server. Using the server to generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of activity that is not allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate the timeouts on servers. These are set at the present values to ensure the reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and are therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed to provide proxy services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.

              The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page. Scripts that send a single email based upon user entered information, or update a database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or perform processor intensive database processes are not allowed. All outgoing mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a Ultifree Hosting-hosted domain.

              Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server resources, or other sites on the same server.
            </p>



            <h4>Usage of Disk Space Terms</h4>



            <p>
              Ultifree Hosting offers large web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts. By this, we mean space for legitimate web site content and bandwidth for visitors to view it. All files on a domain must be part of the active website and linked to the site. Sites should not contain any backups, downloads, or other non-web based content. We will treat all password protected archive (e.g. zip and rar) files as unacceptable. Multimedia content such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to the user, links to HTTP download of this content is not acceptable.
            </p>



            <h4>Inode Usage</h4>



            <p>
              In computing, an inode is a data structure on a traditional Unix-style file system such as UFS. An inode stores basic information about a regular file, directory, or other file system object. A more detailed explanation can be found here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode.

              Ultifree Hosting reserves the right to limit INODEs usage on free hosting plans to 30,019 and to 180,000 on premium hosting plans and unlimited inodes on Business hosting plans subject to acceptable usage.
            </p>



            <h4>Right to Suspend/Terminate Hosting Services</h4>



            <p>
              We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any hosting services if a website/hosting service consumes excessive server resources or effects other websites / hosting services on a shared or clustered hosting server. Excessive resource usage can constitute any form of server usage calculated and determined at the discretion of Ultifree Hosting.

              Ultifree Hosting reserves the right to suspend service at any time without prior notice if or when the health or normal running/performance of a service is effected/degraded by a website or hosting service.

              You acknowledge that Ultifree Hosting may or may not pre-screen Content, but that Ultifree Hosting and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is available via the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, Ultifree Hosting and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by Ultifree Hosting or submitted to Ultifree Hosting, including without limitation information in Ultifree Hosting Message Boards and in all other parts of the Service.

              You acknowledge, consent and agree that Ultifree Hosting may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

            </ol>

You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Service. Any unauthorized reproduction, publication, further distribution or public exhibition of the materials provided on the Service, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.</p>



            <h3> 7. Interstate Nature of Communications on Ultifree Hosting Network</h3>



            <p>When you register with Ultifree Hosting, you acknowledge that in using Ultifree Hosting services to send electronic communications (including but not limited to email, uploading photos and files and other Internet activities), you will be causing communications to be sent through Ultifree Hosting's computer networks, portions of which are located in California, Ohio, UK, and other locations in the United States and portions of which are located abroad. As a result, and also as a result of Ultifree Hosting's network architecture and business practices and the nature of electronic communications, even communications that seem to be intrastate in nature can result in the transmission of interstate communications regardless of where you are physically located at the time of transmission. Accordingly, by agreeing to this Terms of Service, you acknowledge that use of the service results in interstate data transmissions.</p>



            <h3> 8. Special Admonitions for International Use</h3>

            <h3> 28. General Information</h3>



            <p>
              <strong>Entire Agreement</strong>

              The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and Ultifree Hosting and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Ultifree Hosting with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other Ultifree Hosting services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.

              <strong>Choice of Law and Forum</strong>

              The TOS and the relationship between you and Ultifree Hosting shall be governed by the laws of Austria without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Ultifree Hosting agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Tirol, Austria.

              <strong>Waiver and Severability of Terms</strong>

              The failure of Ultifree Hosting to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.

              <strong>No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability</strong>

              You agree that your Ultifree Hosting account is non-transferable and any rights to your Ultifree Hosting ID or contents within your account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted.

              <strong>Statute of Limitations</strong>

              You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

              The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
