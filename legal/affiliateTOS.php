                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Affiliates are paid monthly after a $100 minimum earnings threshold is met. Therefore, the affiliate must reach at least $100 in affiliate commissions to be sent payment. All other Affiliates are subject to the pay terms of the platform from which they pull their affiliate links.</span>

                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultifree Hosting shall automatically generate an invoice on behalf of Affiliate for all Commissions payable under this Agreement and shall remit payment to Affiliate based upon that invoice. All tracking of Links and determinations of Qualified Actions and Commissions shall be made by Ultifree Hosting in its sole discretion. In the event that Affiliate disputes in good faith any portion of an invoice, Affiliate must submit that dispute to Ultifree Hosting in writing and in sufficient detail within thirty (30) days of the date on the invoice. If Affiliate does not dispute the invoice as set forth herein, then Affiliate agrees that it irrevocably waives any claims based upon that invoice. In the event that Affiliate is also tracking Qualified Actions and Affiliate claims a discrepancy, Affiliate must provide Ultifree Hosting with Affiliate’s reports within three (3) days after 30th day of the calendar month, and if Ultifree Hosting and Affiliate’s reported statistics vary by more than 10% and Ultifree Hosting reasonably determines that Affiliate has used generally accepted industry methods to track Qualified Actions, then Ultifree Hosting and Affiliate agree to make a good faith effort to arrive at a reconciliation. If the parties are unable to arrive at a reconciliation, then Ultifree Hosting numbers shall govern.</span>

                  <li style="font-weight: 400;">
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">If Affiliate has an outstanding balance due to Ultifree Hosting under this Agreement or any other agreement between the Affiliate and Ultifree Hosting, whether or not related to the Affiliate Program, Affiliate agrees that Ultifree Hosting may offset any such amounts due to Ultifree Hosting from amounts payable to Affiliate under this Agreement.</span>

                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">We may change the commission structure, volumes and payout mechanisms from time to time at our sole discretion. If there is material change, we will notify you through the Affiliate Dashboard or by email. If you do not agree to any such change, your sole remedy is to terminate your Affiliate account.</span>
